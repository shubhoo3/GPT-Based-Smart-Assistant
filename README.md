# GPT-Based Smart Assistant

The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive voice-controlled assistant leveraging OpenAI's GPT model to understand and respond to user queries in natural language. This assistant aims to enhance user interaction by providing a seamless and intuitive experience through speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion.

The project involves capturing audio commands from users, converting the speech to text, processing the text using the ChatGPT API, and converting the generated responses back into speech. The system is designed to handle natural language queries and provide meaningful responses, thereby improving the user experience.


## Steps Involved in Building the Project 

1. **Voice-Controlled Interaction:** Captures audio commands and   converts them into text.


2. **Conversational AI:** Uses the ChatGPT API to generate intelligent responses.

3. **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech:** Enables smooth communication through spoken and written responses.

4. **Task Automation:** Assists with scheduling, reminders, and productivity tasks.


5. **Multi-Platform Support:** Integrates with web, mobile, and desktop applications.

 

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

1. Python 3.8+

2. OpenAI API Key

3. Flask/Django (for web-based integration, if applicable)

4. Node.js (for frontend development, if applicable)

5. Speech Recognition Library (e.g., SpeechRecognition, PyAudio)

## Usage

- Start the assistant and issue voice commands.

- The system converts speech to text, processes the input via ChatGPT, and responds through synthesized speech.

- Customize responses and behavior in the configuration settings.
